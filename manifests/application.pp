#    cupertinostreamingpacketizer, smoothstreamingpacketizer,
#    sanjosestreamingpacketizer, mpegdashstreamingpacketizer,
#    cupertinostreamingrepeater, smoothstreamingrepeater,
#    sanjosestreamingrepeater, mpegdashstreamingrepeater,
#    dvrstreamingpacketizer, dvrstreamingrepeater
#    See the wowza configurationreference for more information on the different
#    packetizers.
#
#  [*playmethod*]
#    Authentication setting for outgoing connections, possible values are:
#    none, basic and digest

#    connected. Setting this to 0 keeps the application running until the server
#    is shut down.
#
#  [*pingtimeout*]
#    Time (in ms) that the application will wait for a ping response from the
#    client.
#
#  [*validationfrequency*]
#    Time (in ms) that the server will wait during server-to-client validation.
#
#  [*storagedir*]
#    Full path to the directory where the application will read/write files from.
#
#  [*origin_url*]
#    origin url when using the application as a live stream repeater.
#
#  [*target_password_file*]
#    target location for a password file, instead of the default operation ( an
#    empty password file is created ) a symlink is created to the path provided
#    in this parameter.
